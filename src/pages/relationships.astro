    <h1>🔗 Relationships</h1>
    <p>Explore the emotional heart of your party — and the threads that tie them together (or pull them apart).</p>

    <section>
      <h2>❤️ Bonds & Love</h2>
      <p>Track romantic arcs, past relationships, and budding connections — whether it’s a wholesome polycule or a doomed love triangle.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Mark characters as romantic, platonic, complicated, or secret</li>
        <li>Support for polyamory and layered dynamics</li>
        <li>Add dates, turning points, and evolving feelings</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>⚔️ Rivalries & Conflict</h2>
      <p>Adventuring isn’t always peaceful. Map out tension, betrayal, grudges, and grudging respect.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Record duels, betrayals, insults, and rival arcs</li>
        <li>Visualize enemies becoming friends (or vice versa)</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>🧠 Secrets & Influence</h2>
      <p>Not everything is out in the open. Use hidden links, secrets, and notes to keep things interesting for the DM or players.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Create one-way or hidden relationship entries</li>
        <li>Mark influence, manipulation, or obsessions</li>
        <li>Reveal connections slowly over time</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>🌐 Visual Relationship Maps (Coming Soon)</h2>
      <p>We’re building a drag-and-drop map system where you can connect characters with lines, arcs, symbols, and colors — perfect for mapping party dynamics and campaign drama.</p>
