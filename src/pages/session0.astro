      <h2>🎲 What is Session 0?</h2>
      <p>
        Session 0 is where players come together to build the foundation of their campaign.
        You'll decide on tone, safety tools, scheduling, character roles, and party dynamics.
        It helps avoid misunderstandings later and makes sure everyone’s excited and aligned.
